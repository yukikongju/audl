#### How to get player profile

```python

from audl.stats.endpoints.playerprofile import PlayerProfile

# Fetching dataframe from https://theaudl.com/league/players/cbrock
player = PlayerProfile('cbrock')
reg = player.get_regular_seasons_career()
playoffs = player.get_playoffs_career()
games = player.get_season_games_stats(2019)
```

Season=['career', 2022, ..., 2012]
Per=['total', 'game']
Team=['team', 'opponent']


```python
from audl.stats.endpoints.teamstats import TeamStats

# fetching from: https://theaudl.com/stats/team
team_stats = TeamStats('career', 'game', 'opponent') # TeamStats(season, per, team)
df = team_stats.get_table()
```

#### How to get Player Stats

Season=['career', 2022, ..., 2012]
Per=['total', 'game', 'points', 'possessions', 'minutes']

```python
from audl.stats.endpoints.playerstats import PlayerStats

# from https://theaudl.com/stats/player-stats
playerstats = PlayerStats('career', 'total', 'breeze').fetch_table()  # PlayerStats(season, per, team)
```

#### How to fetch season schedule

```python

from audl.stats.endpoints.seasonschedule import SeasonSchedule, TeamSeasonSchedule, AllSchedule, TeamSeasonAgainstOpponentSchedule

# Fetch complete season schedule from https://theaudl.com/league/game-search

df = SeasonSchedule(2022).get_schedule()
df = TeamSeasonSchedule(2022, 'royal').get_schedule()
df = AllSchedule().get_schedule()
df = TeamSeasonAgainstOpponentSchedule(2022, 'royal', 'rush').get_schedule()

```

#### How to get game statistics

```python

from audl.stats.endpoints.gamestats import GameStats

# Fetching Box Scores from https://theaudl.com/stats/game/2021-06-05-RAL-ATL
game = GameStats("2021-06-05-RAL-ATL")
teams = game.get_teams_metadata()
players = game.get_players_metadata()
game_metadata = game.get_game_metadata()
team_stats = game.get_team_stats()
roster = game.get_roster_stats()
scoring_time = game._get_scoring_time()
boxscores = game.get_boxscores()
home_events = game.print_team_events(True)

```
